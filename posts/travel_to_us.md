In December 1930, I visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology.
After the national attention I received during my first trip to the US, me and my arrangers aimed to protect my privacy. 
Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, I declined them all. 
Haha!
