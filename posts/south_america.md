In the months of March and April 1925, I visited **South America**, where I spent about a month in Argentina, a week in Uruguay, and a week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
My visit was initiated by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935)[113] with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones.
The visit by me and my beautiful wife was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.
